## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ **Fast & Reliable**: Built using vanilla JavaScript with zero dependencies for lightning-fast performance.  
✅ **Responsive UI**: Sleek, modern interface designed using `HTML5`, `CSS3`, and `Poppins` typography.  
✅ **Real-time Feedback**: Interactive button animations and alert messages for a smooth user experience.  
✅ **API-Driven**: Uses the trusted `GoQR` API for generating high-quality QR codes dynamically.  
✅ **Minimalist Design**: Focuses purely on function and user clarity — no clutter, just action.
